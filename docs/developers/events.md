# Events
Workflow provides events for extending its functionality. Modules and plugins can register event listeners, typically in their `init()` methods, to modify Workflowâ€™s behavior.

## Submission Events

### The `beforeSaveSubmission` event
The event that is triggered before a submission is saved. You can set `$event->isValid` to false to prevent saving.

```php
use craft\events\ModelEvent;
use verbb\workflow\elements\Submission;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_BEFORE_SAVE, function(ModelEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->sender;

    $event->isValid = false;
});
```

### The `afterSaveSubmission` event
The event that is triggered after a submission is saved.

```php
use craft\events\ModelEvent;
use verbb\workflow\elements\Submission;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Submission::class, Submission::EVENT_AFTER_SAVE, function(ModelEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->sender;
});
```

### The `afterGetReviewerUserGroups` event
The event that is triggered after registering user groups for reviewers.

```php
use verbb\workflow\events\ReviewerUserGroupsEvent;
use verbb\workflow\services\Submissions;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(Submissions::class, Submissions::EVENT_AFTER_GET_REVIEWER_USER_GROUPS, function(ReviewerUserGroupsEvent $event) {
    $submission = $event->submission;
    $userGroups = $event->userGroups;
});
```
